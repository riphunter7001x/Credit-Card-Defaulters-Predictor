# Credit-Card-Defaulters-Predictor

Predicting credit card defaulters using machine learning techniques. This project employs a Random Forest model to analyze historical credit card data and predict the likelihood of default.

## Key Files and Folders

- `ma_ln.py`: Main Python script for running the credit card default prediction model.
- `model_utils.py`: Utility functions for loading the trained model and making predictions.
- `random_forest_model.joblib`: Pre-trained Random Forest model for predicting credit card defaulters.
- `predicted_results.csv`: CSV file containing predicted results based on the model.
- `notebook/`: Folder containing Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration and model development.
- `templates/`: Folder for storing HTML templates (if applicable).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies for easy environment setup.

## Usage

1. Ensure Python dependencies are installed by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the prediction script:
    ```bash
    python maln.py
    ```

3. Access predicted results in `predicted_results.csv`.
